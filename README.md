# Moveo Project Front

I used vite+react+typescript to run this site and I deployed it on netlify
please note that I use free tier for the backend and it may have some down time so if you try to enter the website and you get an error please try again and be patient😊

# Libraries I used
- redux
- react-router-dom
- monaco-editor
- highlight.js
- socket.io-client
- axios

## Run Locally
- first make sure you have the backend running. see how here ➡️ https://github.com/IdanDover/moveo-project-back
- clone the repository
- run 'npm i' in terminal on project directory
- run npm dev
- enjoy 😀
